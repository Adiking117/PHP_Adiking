🔥 PHP Backend Developer Roadmap: From Zero to Production-Ready APIs
This roadmap is divided into Foundations → Intermediate → Advanced, and includes projects, resources, and priorities. Focus first on API building, but you'll also need to understand the ecosystem around backend apps (databases, deployment, security, etc.).

🧱 PHASE 1: Foundations (1–2 weeks)
1. ✅ Learn Core PHP (7.x and 8.x)
Syntax (variables, data types, functions, loops, arrays, conditionals)

Superglobals ($_GET, $_POST, $_SERVER, etc.)

Include/require

Error handling

Sessions and cookies

🔗 Resources:

PHP Manual

W3Schools PHP

📌 Do:

Build simple form that submits data using POST and GET

Handle session login/logout

🧠 PHASE 2: Object-Oriented PHP (OOP) (3–4 days)
Learn:
Classes, Objects

Constructors, Inheritance, Polymorphism

Visibility (public, private, protected)
this super
Static vs Non-static

Traits, Interfaces
Namespaces

Autoloading with Composer (PSR-4)

📌 Do:

Make a class-based User system (User, Admin, etc.)

🔧 PHASE 3: Composer + Dependencies (2 days)
Understand dependency management with Composer

Install external packages (like monolog/monolog)

Learn autoload, require, scripts

🔗 Composer Docs

🌐 PHASE 4: Building REST APIs (1 week)
Key Concepts:
HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Routes and Controllers

Input validation

JSON response (header('Content-Type: application/json'))

Status codes

With Vanilla PHP:
Build a REST API with CRUD for a Product resource

📌 Must Know:

Routing logic

Handling JSON input/output

Sanitizing and validating inputs

Use Postman to test APIs

🗃️ PHASE 5: MySQL + PHP (1 week)
Learn:
MySQL CRUD operations

mysqli or PDO (prefer PDO)

Parameterized queries (to avoid SQL Injection)

Joins, indexes, foreign keys

📌 Do:

Connect PHP to MySQL

Build an API that stores and retrieves data from MySQL

📦 PHASE 6: PHP Framework (2–3 weeks)
Use Laravel (most popular) or Slim (lightweight, great for APIs)

If Laravel:
Routing

Controllers

Models & Eloquent ORM

Migrations and seeders

Validation

Middleware

Authentication (passport or sanctum for APIs)

Error handling

Laravel Queues (for jobs)

🔗 Laravel Docs

📌 Do:

Build a To-do app or Blog API

Secure it with token-based auth

🔐 PHASE 7: Security Essentials
SQL Injection

XSS, CSRF

JWT (JSON Web Token) auth

HTTPS, Password hashing (password_hash)

Rate limiting

Secure headers

🔗 Use:

JWT with firebase/php-jwt

CSRF middleware (Laravel handles this for you)

📁 PHASE 8: File Uploads and Emailing
File handling with $_FILES

Image validation and storage

Sending emails with PHPMailer or Laravel Mail facade

📌 Do:

User profile photo upload

Email verification or password reset

🧪 PHASE 9: Testing and Debugging
Use Xdebug for step-by-step debugging

PHPUnit for unit and feature testing (Laravel has it built-in)

Postman/Newman for API testing

📌 Do:

Write test cases for endpoints

🐘 PHASE 10: Deployment & DevOps
Apache/Nginx + PHP + MySQL

.env files & environment configs

Use Laravel Forge or Docker for containerization

Hosting options:

Shared hosting (cheap)

VPS (e.g., DigitalOcean)

Cloud (AWS, Heroku, Railway)

📌 Learn:

SSH access

crontab for scheduled jobs

Monitor logs (tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log)

🔄 Bonus: Tools & Concepts to Explore
Redis (caching or queueing)

REST vs GraphQL (start with REST)

WebSockets (for real-time apps)

Rate Limiting (Laravel throttle middleware)

API versioning (/api/v1/)

🔧 Project Ideas to Practice
User Auth API — Login, Register, Forgot Password

Task Manager API — Users, Tasks, Comments

Blog API — CRUD for posts, categories, tags

File Upload API — Store and serve images

E-Commerce API — Products, Cart, Orders, Payments (Mock)
